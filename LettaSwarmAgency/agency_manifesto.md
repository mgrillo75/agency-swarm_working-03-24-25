The LettaSwarmAgency is designed to facilitate effective communication between two separate agencies built with different frameworks: Agency Swarm and Letta. The primary mission is to ensure seamless interaction and data exchange between these frameworks. The Lead Agent, built using the Agency Swarm framework, will act as the primary communicator with the user and the Support Agent. The Support Agent, also built using the Agency Swarm framework, will handle communication with the Letta Framework Agent and will have specialized tools for Letta agent initialization and message handling. The Letta Framework Agent will interact with the Support Agent when prompted, ensuring efficient collaboration and information sharing across frameworks.
